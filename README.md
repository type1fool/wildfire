# Wildfire

Wildfire collects network performance data to inform decisions for multi-region and peer-to-peer applications.

For realtime applications with strict latency requirements, there are a few internet protocols available, some of which are more suitable than others. Wildfire helps web engineers determine the feasibility of connections between two regions by measuring performance between two servers using a set of common web protocols.

The application is backed by Erlang's BEAM virtual machine and OTP framework, the Elixir programming language, and the Phoenix framework.
